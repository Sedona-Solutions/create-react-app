# react-scripts-sedona

Create React apps (with Typescript, SCSS and CSS-modules, with typings) with no build configuration.

Create React App works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.<br>
If something doesnâ€™t work please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/new).

## tl;dr

```sh
npm install -g create-react-app@1.3.0
create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-sedona
cd my-app/
npm install --save-dev @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
npm start
```

We recommand to use yarn instead of npm.
To do so, [install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/), and then :
```sh
yarn global add create-react-app@1.3.0
create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-sedona
cd my-app/
yarn add --dev install @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
yarn run start
```

### typings

Custom packages dependencies install doesn't seems to be available without modifying create-react-app itself. <br >
You'll therefore need to install them manually, as shown above.
